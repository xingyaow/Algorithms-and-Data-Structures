Problem 1)

Max n for an int is 12 with a value of 479001600
Max n for an Integer is 12 with a value of 479001600
Max n for a long is 20 with a value of 2432902008176640000
Max n for a float is about 34 with a value of 2.9523e38
Max n for a double is about 170.5 with a value of 5.3504e+307

I did not receive any indication that the numbers were wrong on
everything except the Integer class, but it wasn't the exception 
I was expecting. So, I am unsure if this was actually the correct 
exception.


Problem 2)
The graphs are attached along with Time data and the code I used to run it.

The estimates for each Big O are as follows:

mickey: O(n)? //The ratio changes at random points, it's hard to see a pattern 
minnie: O(n^2) //The time increases by about 4 every time the data is doubled
goofy: O(n^2) //The time increases by about 4 every time the data is doubled
pluto: O(n) //The Time is increased by about 2 every time the data is doubled
